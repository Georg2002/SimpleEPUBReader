If you manage to give JMDict support it will be perfect. Kindle PC fails to translate if there are inflections. Even if you select only the kanji it will fail to give any result. JMDict works fine on Kindle tablet though.

I'm not sure how hard it's to build a lookup tool with the JMDict package for Kindle. It's on github too.
