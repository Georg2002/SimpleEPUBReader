Make sure to install the two fonts in this folder, otherwise you will only see boxes instead of text.


Main features:
-Touch-compatibilty: No tiny buttons and context menus
-Vertical Japanese text: Also displays ruby/furigana correctly
-Fast: No waiting times when changing reader size
-Ability to mark text
-Tense-sensitive dictionary: Takes up to 30 seconds to load ~400000 words, the reader is slower than usual during this time, also takes up 1GB of memory (base programm is ~300MB)

Additional features:
-Library function
-Ability to skip to chapters
-Ability to easily jump between pages
-Ability to load pictures with a non-local(internet) source, which can happen when converting web pages to epub.

Downsides:
-This is not an epub-reader in the normal sense. Usually the html-files inside the epub are displayed using an html-renderer, which (I think so at least, I can't think of any other reason why so many reader-programms are so slow) makes everything quite slow, because the reader has to render the entire book at the same time in order to calculate the page count.
This reader does something that looks very similar to a normal html-renderer, as long as you don't encounter html-elements that are uncommon in books, e.g tables.
-You need to install a font in order to use this reader: I do not know how to include the font in the application for I am not a software developer.
